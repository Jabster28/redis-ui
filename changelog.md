# Change log

## v2018.12.20
* Allows to work with 1 million keys, with reduced functions
  * With keys over 110k keys
    * Sorting is disabled
    * Searching happening only on the server, client side searching is disabled
    * The fancy information on the tree are disabled
* The console TAB completion works with uppercase letters as well

## v2018.12.19
* The client side key sorting is using natural compare (has a small penalty, but under 100k is bearable).
* CONSOLE: TAB or SHIFT + TAB completion like bash is enabled
* CONSOLE: Cursor UP or DOWN history is enabled

## v2018.12.17
* The Redis key tree is resizable now - before it was working with click, now it works with dragging
* Added a new theme - named Enterprise 
* Added a new theme - name Redis 

## v2018.12.16
* The Redis key tree is resizable now 

## v2018.12.15
* I have found, that the best solution is on the server side is to use http instead of https and for security use NGINX (or similar) as a proxy and it is as secure as it can be.

## v2018.12.14
* Due to a variable name, the key sorting was not working, now is.

## v2018.9.28-3
* the AppImage was not working, now I verified on Windows and Linux

## v2018.9.26-0
* the first full version
